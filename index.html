        Bitcoin ETF: Cryptocurrency swings as watchdog X account 'compromised' 
    </h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Bitcoin jumped briefly on Tuesday after a post on the US markets regulator's X account (formerly Twitter) said it had approved new so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the cryptocurrency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later deleted the post and said its account had been <i> "compromised"</i>.
        The social media platform has said the compromised account was not due to a breach of its systems.
        US regulators are expected to make an announcement on the new ETFs this week.
        The false post appeared on the SEC's official X account shortly after 16:00 Washington time (21:00 GMT).
        It said the regulator <i> "grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges".</i>
